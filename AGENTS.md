# Agents

This file is the project's working agreement for coding agents. [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) is a symlink to it.

## Prime Directive

**Follow the docs. Update the docs.**

Before writing any code, read the relevant documentation in `docs/`. After implementing a feature or refactoring, update the docs to reflect
the change. Drift between docs and code is a bug.

## Before You Start

1. Read `docs/conventions.md` — follow every convention without exception
2. Read `docs/documentation.md` — understand where docs live and what goes where
3. Read the relevant `docs/architecture/*.md` files for the area you are working in
4. Read the relevant `docs/features/*.md` files when the task touches a shipped surface
5. Read `docs/infrastructure.md` if your change affects deployment, CI, or environment variables
6. Read the relevant `docs/styles/*.md` files when the task touches presentation, motion, or chat UI

## Working Boundaries

- **Do not create new branches** unless the user explicitly asks you to. Work on the currently checked-out branch.
- **Do not create or switch into a git worktree** unless the user explicitly asks for one. Never invoke `EnterWorktree`, `git worktree add`,
  or spawn an agent with `isolation: "worktree"` on your own initiative.
- **Do not commit or push** unless the user explicitly asks. If the current branch auto-deploys (e.g. via Vercel), stop and ask before
  committing — even when the user requested a commit.
- If you think a branch or worktree would genuinely help (e.g. parallel agents that would otherwise conflict), surface that as a suggestion
  and wait for approval before acting.

## Conventions (Summary)

These are non-negotiable. The full details are in `docs/conventions.md`.

- **Package manager**: npm only. Never use yarn or pnpm.
- **Naming**: entity-action (`sessionUpsert`, `userFindOne`, `toGqlSession`, `guardUserSubscription`)
- **Generated files — do not edit**: `src/routeTree.gen.ts`, `src/server/graphql/generated.ts`, `src/web/graphql/generated.ts`, `drizzle/`
- **Icons**: Lucide React only (`lucide-react`)
- **UI components**: base primitives in `src/web/components/base/`, app components in `src/web/components/`. **Search that tree (and any
  relevant `docs/styles/*.md`) before creating a new component** — reuse or extend what exists; only add a new file when nothing covers the
  job. See [docs/conventions.md](./docs/conventions.md#ui-components).
- **Class merging**: use `cn()` from `src/web/utils/cn.ts`
- **Motion**: every animation must answer a question the user is already asking — see [docs/styles/motion.md](./docs/styles/motion.md) for
  the guardrails, anti-patterns, and reduced-motion stance. No motion library; reuse `Reveal` / `useInView`.
- **Chat presentation**: every chat surface follows [docs/styles/chat.md](./docs/styles/chat.md).
- **GraphQL schema**: SDL-first in `src/server/graphql/schema.graphqls`. Run `npm run graphql:generate` after any schema change.
- **Resolver wiring**: all in `src/server/graphql/resolversCreate.ts` — the only file that imports from commands/, queries/, and guards/
- **Commands**: two-phase writes — build all insert/update payloads first (pure), then run DB work in try/catch (transaction when
  multi-write). See [docs/conventions.md](./docs/conventions.md#commands-database-writes).
- **Environment variables**: never read `process.env` directly — only via `environmentVariablesCreate()`. See
  [docs/architecture/environment.md](./docs/architecture/environment.md).
- **User-facing copy**: English only at the call site — no i18n library and no page-level `COPY` const. Hoist a small named const only for
  strings reused within the file (e.g. shared by `seoMeta()` and the `<h1>`) or needed outside JSX (`aria-label`, `alt`, JSON-LD). Never
  render raw `error.message` in the UI. See [docs/architecture/i18n.md](./docs/architecture/i18n.md) and
  [docs/conventions.md](./docs/conventions.md#user-facing-copy).
- **SEO**: every public page uses `seoMeta()` and is listed in `src/web/seo/sitemapRoutes.ts` when indexable. Private / transactional pages
  pass `noindex: true` and stay out of the sitemap.
- **Jobs**: handlers in `src/server/jobs/handlers/`, registered in `jobDefinitions.ts`; enqueue via `serverRuntime.jobs.enqueue()`.
- **Comments**: only comment if there is no other way to make the code self-explanatory — prefer better names, smaller functions, and
  clearer types
- **Quality checks**: run `npm run check` and `npm test` before considering any task complete

## Architecture at a Glance

One row per doc under `docs/architecture/`. Feature behavior lives in `docs/features/` — do not duplicate it here. Presentation rules live
in `docs/styles/`.

## How to Add Things

### New Database Table

1. Define in `src/server/db/schema.ts` with `pgTable()`
2. Export inferred types: `type Foo = typeof foo.$inferSelect`, `type FooCreate = typeof foo.$inferInsert`
3. Generate migration: `npm run db:generate`
4. Apply migration: `npm run db:migrate` (or `npm run db:push` for quick dev iteration)

### New GraphQL Operation

1. Add types/fields to `src/server/graphql/schema.graphqls`
2. Run `npm run graphql:generate`
3. Implement the command (mutation) or query in `src/server/commands/` or `src/server/queries/`
4. Add a mapper in `src/server/mappers/` if transforming DB types to GraphQL types
5. Wire the resolver in `src/server/graphql/resolversCreate.ts`
6. For protected operations, add a guard in `src/server/guards/` and call it in the resolver
7. Add the client-side `.graphql` operation file alongside the route or component

### New Public Page

1. Add the route under `src/routes/` (e.g. `src/routes/about.tsx` → `/about`)
2. Use `seoMeta()` in `head()` with English `title` / `description`
3. **Add the path to `src/web/seo/sitemapRoutes.ts`** if it should be indexed
4. Page copy is plain English at the call site
5. See [docs/architecture/discovery-seo.md](./docs/architecture/discovery-seo.md); when GEO surfaces exist, also mirror
   [docs/architecture/discovery-geo.md](./docs/architecture/discovery-geo.md)

### New Background Job

1. Add a handler in `src/server/jobs/handlers/{entityAction}.ts` exporting a `RecurringJobDefinition` or `QueuedJobDefinition`
2. Register it in `src/server/jobs/jobDefinitions.ts`
3. Re-export from `src/server/jobs/index.ts` if callers need it
4. Enqueue queued jobs via `serverRuntime.jobs.enqueue(definition, data, options)`
5. See [docs/architecture/jobs.md](./docs/architecture/jobs.md) for the full recipe

### New Agent Tool

1. Prefer colocating the AI-SDK `tool()` wrapper on the command it wraps (under `src/server/commands/`), not a separate `agents/toolX.ts`
2. For multi-domain assistants, add or extend a sub-agent and a `delegateTo…` tool on the orchestrator — see
   [docs/architecture/agent-delegation.md](./docs/architecture/agent-delegation.md)
3. Wire tools into the relevant agent factory under `src/server/agents/`
4. Update the matching `docs/features/` doc (and architecture docs if the pattern changes)

### New Feature

1. Implement following the patterns above
2. Create a feature doc in `docs/features/{feature-name}.md` covering: user behavior, options considered, option chosen, implementation
   details

### New Architectural Decision

1. Create a doc in `docs/architecture/{decision-name}.md` covering: context, decision, alternatives considered, consequences
2. Add a row to the Architecture table above

## Documentation Update Rules

You MUST update documentation when any of the following occur:

| What Changed                          | What to Update                               |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| New feature implemented               | Add `docs/features/{feature}.md`             |
| New convention established            | Update `docs/conventions.md`                 |
| New architectural pattern introduced  | Add `docs/architecture/{pattern}.md`         |
| Presentation / motion / chat UI bar   | Update the relevant `docs/styles/*.md`       |
| Existing architecture changed         | Update the relevant `docs/architecture/*.md` |
| Deployment or CI changed              | Update `docs/infrastructure.md`              |
| File renamed, moved, or deleted       | Update any doc that references it            |
| Environment variable added or changed | Update `docs/infrastructure.md`              |

If you are unsure whether a doc needs updating, it does.
