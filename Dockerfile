# Browser capture: Playwright + Chromium. These layers are placed
# before the application copy so they cache across application code
# changes — the Chromium download dominates image build time and rarely
# changes. See `docs/architecture/browser-capture.md`.
#
# Nitro inlines the rest of the app. The runtime `node_modules` only needs
# playwright (chromium-bidi loads via paths Vite cannot statically resolve).
# Installing the full production tree with `npm ci --omit=dev` would extract
# hundreds of packages the container never imports.
#
# The Debian-based `node:24-slim` base is required — Chromium's prebuilt
# binaries are linked against glibc and will not run on Alpine.
#
# `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` pins the browser install to a fixed,
# user-independent location. The install steps below run as root (HOME
# would be /root), but the container runs as `node` (HOME=/home/node) —
# without a shared path, Chromium downloads into /root/.cache and the
# runtime process searching /home/node/.cache finds nothing. Setting the
# env once covers both install and runtime.
