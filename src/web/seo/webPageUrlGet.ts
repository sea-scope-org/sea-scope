// sitemap. The `.server()` body is stripped from the client bundle by the
// TanStack Start plugin (same pattern as `routeLoaderGraphqlClient`), so the
// server-only `environmentVariables` import does not leak.
//
// On the client we fall back to `window.location.origin`. That divergence
// from the configured `WEB_PAGE_URL` is intentional and harmless: crawlers
// see the SSR-rendered head where the server value is correct; client-side
// navigations only update the head locally and a localhost origin during
// dev/preview is the right answer there.
