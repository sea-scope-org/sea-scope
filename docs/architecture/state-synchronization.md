# Real-Time (Subscriptions)

## Context

The application needs real-time updates for user state changes and AI generation streaming. The transport must work through standard HTTP
infrastructure without requiring WebSocket upgrades.

## Decision

GraphQL subscriptions over Server-Sent Events (SSE), backed by PostgreSQL NOTIFY/LISTEN for pub-sub.

### Data Flow

1. Client initiates a subscription via the URQL SSE exchange, which sends a POST to `/api/stream`
2. The server route creates a `ReadableStream` and starts the subscription
3. `executeGraphQLSubscription()` calls the resolver's `subscribe` method
4. The resolver calls `serverRuntime.subscribe.to(key)`, which returns an `AsyncIterableIterator` from `PubSubPostgres`
5. `PubSubPostgres` issues `LISTEN "key"` on a dedicated PostgreSQL connection
6. When something publishes (e.g., `serverRuntime.publish.chatUpdates()`), `PubSubPostgres` calls `SELECT pg_notify($1, $2)`
7. PostgreSQL delivers the notification to the listener connection
8. The payload flows through the `AsyncIterableIterator` back to the SSE stream as `event: next\ndata: {...}\n\n`
9. The URQL SSE client receives the event and updates the React component

### PubSubPostgres Design

Key design decisions in `src/server/graphql/PubSubPostgres.ts`:

- **Dedicated listener connection**: LISTEN requires a long-lived connection that is not pooled. A separate `pg.Client` is used for
  listening while the pool handles publishing and regular queries.
- **Lowercase channel normalization**: PostgreSQL folds unquoted identifiers to lowercase, but `pg_notify()` takes a text parameter with no
  folding. All channel names are normalized to lowercase to prevent mismatches.
- **Ref-counted LISTEN/UNLISTEN**: Multiple subscribers to the same channel share a single `LISTEN`. The channel is only `UNLISTEN`ed when
  the last subscriber disconnects.
- **Per-trigger lock**: A promise chain per channel prevents concurrent subscribe/unsubscribe operations from racing.
- **PubSubMemory**: An in-memory `EventEmitter`-based alternative for testing or environments without PostgreSQL.

### SSE Stream Details

The `/api/stream` endpoint (`src/routes/api/stream.ts`):

- Sends an initial padding comment (2048 spaces) to force proxy flush
- Formats events as standard SSE: `id: N\nevent: next\ndata: JSON\n\n`
- Properly cleans up the subscription iterator when the client disconnects (`cancel()` on the `ReadableStream`)
- Handles controller-closed errors gracefully

### Subscription Channels

Currently defined in `ServerRuntime.publish` (see `src/server/domain/serverRuntimeCreate.ts`):

| Channel          | Trigger Key                   | Wire payload                                 | GraphQL delivery                    | Use Case                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userUpdates`    | `{userId}`                    | `{}`                                         | (reload / invalidate)               | User state changes (legacy; no SeaScope auth UX)            |
| `chatUpdates`    | `chat-updates:{generationId}` | `ChatUpdateWirePayload` (ids / small deltas) | Resolver reloads → `GqlSChatUpdate` | AI generation streaming and chat-message lifecycle          |
| `sessionUpdates` | `session-updates:{sessionId}` | `SessionUpdateWirePayload`                   | Resolver reloads watch/intel        | Watch ticks, anomalies, risk/incidents, vessel intelligence |

Publish puts a **wire payload** on NOTIFY (pg_notify is capped at 8000 bytes) — see
[chat.md](./chat.md#why-the-wire-payload-is-the-id-not-the-full-message). The subscription resolver reloads full rows before delivering
GraphQL types. The `chat-updates:` / `session-updates:` prefixes namespace channels so ids cannot collide with other keys; `userUpdates`
publishes directly against the user id with no prefix.

`sessionUpdates` is server-bound to the requesting cookie session id (clients cannot subscribe to another session's channel). Variants:
`SessionUpdateWatchSnapshot`, `SessionUpdateAnomalyAppended`, `SessionUpdateIntelligence`. Client blueprint:
`src/web/maritime/useSessionUpdates.ts`.

### Key Files

- `src/server/graphql/PubSubPostgres.ts` — pub-sub implementation (both PostgreSQL and memory variants); 7500-byte soft ceiling on publish
- `src/server/graphql/chatUpdateWirePayload.ts` — lean chat-update NOTIFY payload
- `src/server/graphql/sessionUpdateWirePayload.ts` — lean session-update NOTIFY payload
- `src/server/domain/ServerRuntime.ts` — typed publish/subscribe interface
- `src/server/domain/serverRuntimeCreate.ts` — wiring PubSubPostgres into ServerRuntime
- `src/server/graphql/resolversCreate.ts` — subscription resolver definitions
- `src/routes/api/stream.ts` — SSE endpoint
- `src/web/graphql/client.ts` — URQL SSE client configuration

## Alternatives Considered

- **WebSockets (e.g., graphql-ws)**: More common for GraphQL subscriptions but requires WebSocket upgrade support from all infrastructure
  (load balancers, proxies). SSE works over standard HTTP.
- **Polling**: Simpler but higher latency and server load; unsuitable for token-by-token AI streaming
- **Redis pub-sub**: More scalable for multi-process deployments but adds an infrastructure dependency. PostgreSQL NOTIFY/LISTEN is
  sufficient when all app instances share one Postgres (our self-hosted VPS).

## Consequences

- SSE is unidirectional (server to client) — client-to-server communication still goes through mutations
- PostgreSQL NOTIFY payload is limited to ~8000 bytes — large payloads must be chunked or referenced by ID
- Single listener connection means a single point of failure for all subscriptions — the reconnection logic handles this but there is a
  brief gap

## Client Consumption: Seed-and-Subscribe

The pub-sub plumbing is only half the contract. The other half is that the client treats the subscription payload as the source of truth —
the route loader seeds initial state, and every server push **replaces** that state. Mutations never re-fetch from the client side.

### The Pattern

For any page that displays owned data kept fresh via `userUpdates` (or a similar channel):

1. Define a `fragment <Page>User on User` in the page's `.graphql` file capturing the page's exact selection.
2. The route's load query spreads that fragment under `sessionFindOne.user`:
   ```graphql
   query <Page> {
       sessionFindOne { user { ...<Page>User } }
   }
   ```
3. A sibling subscription on `userUpdates` spreads the same fragment — the payload type matches the seed type:
   ```graphql
   subscription <Page>Updates {
       userUpdates { ...<Page>User }
   }
   ```
4. The page seeds `useState<GqlC<Page>UserFragment>(loaderData.sessionFindOne.user)` once on mount.
5. An imperative URQL subscription replaces that state on every push. Use `client.executeSubscription` + `pipe(subscribe(...))` from `wonka`
   — **never** `useSubscription`. URQL's declarative hook can deliver each event more than once under concurrent React (its reducer runs
   inside a state-updater callback that React may invoke multiple times); production-tested in `useChatLiveUpdates.tsx`.
6. Mutations call the server and return. They do **not** call `router.invalidate()`, refetch, or set state. Commands that own the data
   publish `serverRuntime.publish.userUpdates({ userId })` after commit — the subscription closes the loop.

### Reference Implementations

- `src/web/chat/useChatLiveUpdates.tsx` — the chat-updates blueprint (multi-generation `generationId` channels).
- `src/web/maritime/useSessionUpdates.ts` — watch-console `sessionUpdates` seed-and-subscribe.

### Why Inline, Not a Generic Hook

The hook is ~25 lines and the body is mostly the fragment-specific type parameter. A premature abstraction would either erase the type
(`unknown` payload) or thread a generic that adds friction without saving code. When a third consumer lands, extract then.
