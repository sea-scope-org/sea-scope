# API Layer

## Context

The application needs a type-safe API layer serving queries, mutations and real-time subscriptions, with shared types between server and  
client. Route loaders must also access the API during SSR with full session/cookie continuity.

## Decision

SDL-first GraphQL schema with Apollo Server (server), URQL (client), and GraphQL Code Generator for type safety.

### Schema

The schema is defined in `src/server/graphql/schema.graphqls` as a single SDL file. This is the single source of truth — all generated types
derive from it.

### Server (Apollo Server v5)

Apollo Server is set up in `src/server/graphql/server.ts` with two execution paths:

- `executeGraphQLQuery()` — for queries and mutations (via Apollo's `executeOperation`)
- `executeGraphQLSubscription()` — for subscriptions (via GraphQL's `subscribe()` directly, bypassing Apollo since Apollo Server does not
  handle subscriptions natively)

The schema is built with `@graphql-tools/schema` (`makeExecutableSchema`) combining the SDL and resolvers from `resolversCreate()`. The SDL
file is imported with Vite's `?raw` suffix (`import schemaSource from './schema.graphqls?raw'`) so its contents are inlined into the server
bundle — runtime `readFileSync` against a relative path would fail in the production Docker image, which only copies `.output/`.

### Client (URQL)

URQL is configured in `src/web/graphql/client.ts` with:

- **POST-only fetch**: all operations use POST (custom fetch converts any GET-style requests)
- **SSE subscription exchange**: subscriptions connect to `/api/stream` via `graphql-sse`
- `**cache-first` request policy\*\*: reduces redundant network requests

### Code Generation

`npm run graphql:generate` runs `@graphql-codegen/cli` with the config in `codegen.ts`:

| Output                            | Prefix   | Plugins                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/server/graphql/generated.ts` | `GqlS`\* | `typescript`, `typescript-resolvers`, `typescript-validation-schema` (Zod) |
| `src/web/graphql/generated.ts`    | `GqlC*`  | `typescript`, `typescript-operations`, `typed-document-node`               |

Server types include resolver type definitions and Zod validation schemas (`GqlS<Input>Schema()` factories and `GqlS<Enum>Schema`). Those
generated Zod schemas are the **default agent-tool `inputSchema`** — see
[agent-delegation.md — Tool input schemas](./agent-delegation.md#tool-input-schemas) (`DateTime` / `z.date()` is the documented exception).
Client types include operation types and `TypedDocumentNode` for type-safe URQL hooks.

The client output uses one extra config flag, `importSchemaTypesFrom: 'src/web/graphql/generated'`, that is load-bearing. Without it, the
`typescript` plugin emits each input type and enum once, and `typescript-operations` re-emits any of them referenced by an operation's
variables — TypeScript then fails the build with TS2300 duplicate-identifier errors. The flag tells `typescript-operations` to skip
re-emission and reference those types through the `Schema` namespace alias instead. Pointing it at the file's own path turns that into a
type-only self-import (`import type * as Schema from './generated'`), which TypeScript accepts because type-only imports erase. This keeps
the entire client surface in a single file with the `GqlC` prefix preserved and operations authored in `.graphql` files.

### Union and Interface Resolution

Union and interface members are discriminated by an explicit `gqlTypeName` field that exists **only in TypeScript** — it is added via module
augmentation in `src/server/graphql/extensions.ts` and is not part of `schema.graphqls`, so it never crosses the wire.

```typescript
import './generated';

declare module './generated' {
  export interface GqlSChatMessageUser {
    gqlTypeName: 'ChatMessageUser';
  }
  export interface GqlSChatMessageAssistantText {
    gqlTypeName: 'ChatMessageAssistantText';
  }
  // …one per union/interface member
}
```

The resolver wiring then plugs the field straight into `__resolveType`:

```typescript
ChatMessage: {
    __resolveType(obj: GqlSChatMessage) {
        return obj.gqlTypeName;
    },
},
```

Why this pattern:

- **The discriminator is enforced at compile time.** Every command/mapper/query that produces a union member must set `gqlTypeName` — the
  type system fails the build otherwise. No runtime "did I forget the tag?" surprises.
- **Nothing leaks to the client.** Because the field isn't in the SDL, GraphQL strips it during serialization. The wire payload only carries
  `__typename` (which Apollo derives from the resolver's return).
- **No central switch to maintain.** A typical `__resolveType` walks the object's shape (`if ('approvalId' in obj)`) and grows brittle as
  variants are added. Reading an explicit field is O(1) and impossible to forget.
- **No DB tag column required.** Persistence can use whatever shape it wants; the discriminator is a server-side concern attached at the
  mapper layer.

### API Routes

- `POST /api/graphql` — handles queries and mutations (`src/routes/api/graphql.ts`)
- `POST /api/stream` — handles subscriptions via SSE (`src/routes/api/stream.ts`)
- `POST /api/file-uploads` — multipart upload (`src/routes/api/file-uploads.ts`)
- `GET  /api/file-uploads/:fileUploadId` — streams the file's bytes (`src/routes/api/file-uploads_.$fileUploadId.ts` — the trailing
  underscore is required so TanStack's file-router does not group the GET route as a nested layout under `/api/file-uploads`)

Both GraphQL routes upsert the session and pass it as Apollo context. The file-upload routes upsert the session via the same cookie path.

### Dev-only `Sec-Fetch-Dest` strip

Nitro's vite dev middleware (`node_modules/nitro/dist/_build/vite.dev.mjs`) classifies an incoming request as a static asset whenever
`Sec-Fetch-Dest` is anything other than `document` / `iframe` / `frame`, and routes it through Vite's static pipeline before Nitro's handler
ever runs. Browsers send `Sec-Fetch-Dest: image` for `<img src=…>`, so a same-origin `<img src="/api/file-uploads/<id>">` would be diverted
into Vite's asset pipeline and answered with the generic `Cannot GET …` HTML 404 — even though the route is wired correctly and the same URL
works in a new tab (which sends `Sec-Fetch-Dest: document`).

`vite.config.ts` mounts a `serve`-only plugin (`apiSecFetchDestStrip`) that deletes `Sec-Fetch-Dest` from any request whose path starts with
`/api/`, so those requests fall through to Nitro and reach the route handler. Production builds do not use Vite's middleware — Nitro owns
routing outright there — so the patch is dev-only and ships nothing.

## SSR Data Loading

TanStack Start route loaders run on both server (SSR) and client (navigation). The GraphQL layer needs to be accessible from loaders with
full session continuity — cookies must flow from the incoming request to the GraphQL endpoint, and any `Set-Cookie` responses must propagate
back to the browser.

### Usage

```ts
import { routeLoaderGraphqlClient } from '../web/graphql/routeLoaderGraphqlClient';
import { HomePageDocument } from '../web/graphql/generated';

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  loader: routeLoaderGraphqlClient(HomePageDocument),
  component() {
    const loaderData = Route.useLoaderData();
    // loaderData is fully typed as GqlCHomePageQuery
  },
});
```

For queries with variables:

```ts
loader: ({ params }) => routeLoaderGraphqlClient(SomeDocument)(params),
```

### Filter state in the URL

Filter state — what the user is _looking at_ — belongs in the URL, not in `useState`. The loader sees it through `loaderDeps`, so SSR
returns the correct filtered payload on first paint, and reloads / shared links / back button all preserve the view.

```ts
const fooSearchSchema = z.object({
  category: z.enum(['a', 'b']).optional(), // absent === "all"
  includeDismissed: z.boolean().optional(), // absent === false
});

export const Route = createFileRoute('/.../foo')({
  validateSearch: fooSearchSchema,
  loaderDeps: ({ search }) => ({
    category: search.category ?? null,
    includeDismissed: search.includeDismissed ?? false,
  }),
  loader: ({ deps }) =>
    routeLoaderGraphqlClient(FooDocument, {
      category: deps.category,
      includeDismissed: deps.includeDismissed,
    })(),
  component: FooPage,
});
```

In the component:

- Read state via `Route.useSearch()` instead of `useState`.
- Filter toggles are `<Link search={prev => ({...prev, …})} replace>`. Top-of-page sub-view switchers use `SectionTabs` — do not call
  section tabs "chips".
- After a mutation, call `router.invalidate()` (from `useRouter()`) — the loader re-runs with the current URL state.
- One canonical URL per state: the default value drops the key entirely (`category=all` → no `?category=` at all).

Ephemeral local state (which row is expanded, which form is being edited) stays in `useState`. Filter state — the lens — goes in the URL.

#### When to keep `useQuery`

The loader pattern is the default for file-route data. Reach for `useQuery` only when the surface needs reactive updates the loader can't
model — live subscriptions, polling, cache-shared lists driven by client-only state. Mutations don't justify `useQuery`:
`router.invalidate()` re-runs the loader and keeps the SSR-first invariant intact.

### Isomorphic Execution

| Environment | Execution path                                 | Why                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Server      | `fetch('/api/graphql')` with forwarded headers | Session middleware runs, Set-Cookie propagates to the SSR response |
| Client      | `urqlClientSimple.query()`                     | Browser has cookies, avoids unnecessary RPC hop                    |

Uses `createIsomorphicFn()` from TanStack Start to split execution by environment.

### Session & Cookie Handover

During SSR, the original client request's cookies are forwarded to the internal GraphQL fetch. Any `Set-Cookie` headers returned by the
GraphQL endpoint (e.g., new session creation) are propagated back to the SSR response using `response.headers.getSetCookie()` (iterates each
cookie individually to avoid corruption from comma-joining).

The SSR hop must target an **HTTPS** origin when the site is served behind a TLS-terminating proxy (Coolify/Traefik). Building the GraphQL
URL from `request.url` is unsafe here: srvx ≥0.11.22 ignores `X-Forwarded-Proto` unless `trustProxy` is enabled, so `request.url` becomes
`http://…` inside the container. Node `fetch` then follows Traefik's HTTP→HTTPS `307`, and the `Cookie` header is dropped on that
cross-scheme redirect — every document load mints a new session. `routeLoaderGraphqlClient` therefore builds the origin with
`getRequestProtocol()` + `getRequestHost()` (h3 still honours `X-Forwarded-*` by default).

### Header Forwarding

The server path forwards an explicit allowlist of client headers to the internal GraphQL request:

- `cookie` — session authentication
- `user-agent` — analytics, bot detection
- `accept-language` — client preference (forwarded; UI is English-only)
- `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip` — rate limiting, geo
- `origin`, `referer` — CSRF, analytics

Headers like `host`, `content-length`, and `connection` are intentionally excluded to avoid breaking the internal fetch.

### Print Caching

`print(document)` serializes the AST to a query string. Since route documents are static module-level constants, a
`WeakMap<DocumentNode, string>` cache ensures `print()` runs once per document for the lifetime of the process.

### Type Safety Chain

```
.graphql file
  → npm run graphql:generate
    → TypedDocumentNode<GqlCFooQuery, GqlCFooQueryVariables>
      → routeLoaderGraphqlClient(FooDocument) returns () => Promise<GqlCFooQuery>
        → Route.useLoaderData() infers GqlCFooQuery
```

### Error Handling

1. Non-2xx HTTP status — throws before JSON parsing
2. GraphQL `errors` array — throws with first error message
3. Missing `data` field — throws explicit error

## Alternatives Considered

- **Code-first schema (e.g., Pothos, Nexus)**: Better colocation with resolvers but adds a build step and hides the schema shape
- **tRPC**: No schema file at all but loses the GraphQL ecosystem (subscriptions, tooling, introspection)
- **Relay client**: More opinionated pagination and caching but heavier setup; URQL is lighter and sufficient
- **Direct resolver calls in loaders** (SSR): Avoids the HTTP round-trip but couples the SSR layer to resolver internals, requires
  replicating session/auth logic, and prevents splitting the GraphQL server into its own service later
- `**createServerFn` (server-only)\*\* (SSR): Simpler but forces client-side navigation through TanStack's RPC layer instead of fetching
  GraphQL directly, adding an unnecessary hop

## Consequences

- Schema changes require running `npm run graphql:generate` before types are updated
- Two separate generated files (server/client) with distinct prefixes prevent accidental cross-imports
- Apollo Server does not natively support subscriptions, so the subscription path uses `graphql`'s `subscribe()` directly
- Every SSR page load makes an internal HTTP request to itself — negligible latency (localhost) but worth knowing for debugging
- The header forwarding allowlist must be maintained if new headers become relevant to resolvers
- `urqlClientSimple` has no cache exchange — each client-side navigation re-fetches. This is intentional (fresh data) but means two routes
  sharing a query will double-fetch
