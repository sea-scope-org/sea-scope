# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

## Context

GraphQL resolvers can grow complex when mutations (writes) and queries (reads) share the same code structure. Mapping logic between database
types and GraphQL types is often duplicated across both.

## Decision

Separate server-side logic into three directories:

- **`src/server/commands/`** — mutation resolvers (write operations)
- **`src/server/queries/`** — query resolvers (read operations)
- **`src/server/mappers/`** — shared transformation functions

### Commands

Each file exports a single async function that performs a write operation. Commands may:

- Insert, update, or delete database records
- Call AI agents from `src/server/agents/`
- Publish events via `ServerRuntime.publish`
- Return GraphQL types (using mappers for the transformation)
- Export a colocated AI-SDK `tool()` factory (`tool<Domain><Action>`) when a sub-agent needs to call the same write — see
  [agent-delegation.md](./agent-delegation.md)

Example: `sessionUpsert.ts` creates or updates a session and returns `GqlSSession`.

### Queries

Each file exports a single async function that performs a read operation. Queries:

- Select from the database
- Transform results using mappers
- Return GraphQL types

Resolver-mounted query files follow `{accessPath}{Entity}{FindOne|FindMany|Count|Counts}` (see
[conventions.md](../conventions.md#query-naming)). Internal helpers used only by commands, agents, or other queries may omit the access-path
prefix but keep the cardinality suffix (`chatFindOne`, `fileUploadFindOne`).

Example pattern: `userFindOne.ts`, `sessionFindMany.ts`.

### Mappers

Pure functions that transform a database row type to its corresponding GraphQL type. Named `toGql{Entity}`.

Example: `toGqlSession(session: Session): GqlSSession`

Mappers are shared by both commands and queries, eliminating duplicate transformation logic.

### Wiring

All functions are imported and called in `src/server/graphql/resolversCreate.ts`:

```typescript
export function resolversCreate(): GqlSResolvers {
  const serverRuntime = serverRuntimeCreate();
  return {
    Query: {
      session: (_, __, ctx) => sessionFindOne(serverRuntime, ctx),
    },
    Mutation: {
      doSomething: (_, args, ctx) => someCommand(serverRuntime, args, ctx),
    },
  };
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

- **Flat resolvers file**: Simpler but gets unwieldy quickly; no separation of read/write concerns
- **Domain-driven directories (per entity)**: Groups all session logic together but obscures the read/write separation and makes it harder
  to enforce consistency

## Consequences

- Clear separation of read and write paths
- Mappers prevent duplication and ensure consistent type transformations
- One function per file keeps each module focused and testable
- `resolversCreate.ts` is the single wiring point — it grows linearly with the schema but keeps the dependency graph visible
