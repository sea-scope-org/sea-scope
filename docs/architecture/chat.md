# Chat Foundation

## Context

The app needs several kinds of chat surface — direct human-to-human conversations, assistant-driven flows, and likely more. They share the
same primitives: a stream of heterogeneous messages, tool-call indications when an assistant is involved, and rich input prompts so the
assistant can collect structured answers without freeform parsing. A single shared model keeps each surface from re-inventing message
polymorphism, picker shapes, and approval round-trips, and prevents the URQL cache from fragmenting along arbitrary lines.

Persistence and LLM replay are out of scope here — see [Chat Persistence](./chat-persistence.md).

## Decision

A polymorphic `ChatMessage` union lives in `src/server/graphql/schema.graphqls` and is consumed by every chat surface in the app. The rest
of this doc walks each piece of the union and the rules that hold across them.

### The message union

```graphql
union ChatMessage =
  | ChatMessageUser
  | ChatMessageUserInput
  | ChatMessageAssistantText
  | ChatMessageToolCall
  | ChatMessageToolApprovalRequest
  | ChatMessageToolApprovalResponse
  | ChatMessageAssistantInputCollection
```

Each variant carries only the fields it actually needs. Codegen produces a TypeScript discriminated union keyed on `__typename`, which gives
exhaustive `switch` checks at the call site without requiring a GraphQL `interface` wrapper. Union resolution uses the project's standard
`gqlTypeName` discriminator pattern — see [Union and Interface Resolution](./api-layer.md#union-and-interface-resolution).

`ChatMessageUser` carries `attachments: [FileUpload!]!`, returned in send-order; the field is non-nullable but always populated (empty list
when the message had none). The bytes themselves live in the template-wide [`FileUploads`](./file-storage.md) store; the chat-specific
concern is the join row that pins them to a message. The LLM-side replay folds the bytes into `FilePart` (carrying the attachment's
`mediaType`; AI SDK v7 removed the dedicated `ImagePart`). See [Chat Persistence — Attachments](./chat-persistence.md#attachments).

### Assistant input collections collect N typed values per turn

A single assistant turn can prompt for several related values at once (e.g. "what dates, how many people, which cuisine?"). Forcing one
input per round-trip would balloon the message log and stall the agent loop on every field. The model is therefore a _collection_ of typed
slots:

```graphql
type ChatMessageAssistantInputCollection {
  chatMessageId: ID!
  prompt: String! # framing for the whole form
  inputs: [ChatAssistantInput!]! # 1..N typed slots, rendered top-to-bottom
  mode: String! # "Form" | "StepThrough" — render mode picked by the LLM
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

union ChatAssistantInput =
  | ChatAssistantInputDate
  | ChatAssistantInputDateRange
  | ChatAssistantInputDateTime
  | ChatAssistantInputTime
  | ChatAssistantInputSingleSelect
  | ChatAssistantInputMultiSelect
  | ChatAssistantInputBoolean
  | ChatAssistantInputText
```

Every variant carries `inputId: ID!` (keys answers back to slots, surviving reorders) and `prompt: String!` (per-slot label, distinct from
the collection-level framing prompt). Variant-specific fields (a select's `options`, a picker's range bounds) live only on the variants that
need them.

There is no `required` flag. Any individual slot may be left blank, and the whole form may be submitted with no answers. "Required" is a
concept the LLM is poorly placed to enforce — it never blocks the agent loop because the user's response shape is the same regardless — and
the UI's job is to make answering low-friction, not to reject incomplete forms.

**Render mode is the LLM's choice — with a hard cap.** `Form` shows every slot at once on a single card; `StepThrough` walks the user
through one slot at a time with Back / Skip / Next controls. The submitted answer set is identical between modes — both accumulate drafts
client-side and submit the same `chatInputCollectionRespond` batch. `mode` exists purely for rendering and to round-trip the LLM's choice
through the `toModelMessages` replay. **`form` is only valid for ≤4 slots** (`FORM_MODE_MAX_SLOTS` in `toolPromptUserForInput.ts`). Longer
collections are coerced to `stepThrough` at parse time so a model that ignores the schema description cannot dump a wall of fields on the
user.

**Select options are natural-language labels only.** The wire schema is `options: [String!]!` — no separate value key. The user sees and
submits the label; the LLM maps answered labels back to tool-arg enums itself. CamelCase identifiers that slip through are humanized before
persistence (`selectOptionToNaturalLanguage`) so the UI never shows raw keys.

**Produced by the `promptUserForInput` tool.** The LLM never emits a `ChatMessageAssistantInputCollection` directly. Every agent that needs
structured input is given the `promptUserForInput` tool (`src/server/agents/toolPromptUserForInput.ts`). Its Zod input schema mirrors the
union above; the tool has no `execute`. Two pieces of plumbing turn the tool call into the on-screen form:

1. **`chatAssistantTurnRun` translates at persistence time.** When `onStepEnd` sees a tool call named `promptUserForInput`, it writes a
   `chatMessagesAssistantInputCollection` row (assigning each slot a fresh `inputId`) instead of the generic `chatMessagesToolCall` row.
   Without this branch the form would render as the bland "Called `promptUserForInput`" pill every other tool gets.
2. **The agent loop stops on this tool call.** `agentUserConversation` lists `hasToolCall('promptUserForInput')` alongside `isStepCount(5)`
   in `stopWhen`. Because the tool has no `execute`, there is no result to feed back into the loop — the next turn-taker is the human.
   Without this stop condition, Gemini would keep stepping and tend to apologize that "the tool failed", producing a phantom assistant text
   right next to the form.
3. **Same-step preamble text is persisted before the collection.** The system prompt coaches the model to narrate briefly before calling
   `promptUserForInput`, so the model often emits a few words alongside the tool call. Persistence writes that preamble as a
   `chatMessagesAssistantText` row _first_ (reusing the streaming step id so the live preview swaps in place), then the
   `assistantInputCollection` at `createdAt + 1ms`. The collection stays the transcript tail, so Submit stays unlocked. Writing the text
   _after_ the collection would lock the form; dropping it made the narration vanish on `TurnEnded`.

The user's reply is a `ChatMessageUserInput`. On the next round, `toModelMessages` replays the collection as a `promptUserForInput`
tool-call and the `ChatMessageUserInput` as the matching tool-result, so the LLM sees its own original turn shape — see
[Chat Persistence](./chat-persistence.md).

### User input is one append-only message per collection

A user's reply to a collection is one message carrying every answered slot:

```graphql
type ChatMessageUserInput {
  chatMessageId: ID!
  author: User!
  collectionMessageId: ID! # which form is being answered
  answers: [ChatMessageUserInputAnswer!]!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

type ChatMessageUserInputAnswer {
  inputId: ID!
  value: ChatAssistantInputValue!
}

union ChatAssistantInputValue =
  | ChatAssistantInputValueDate
  | ChatAssistantInputValueDateRange
  | ChatAssistantInputValueDateTime
  | ChatAssistantInputValueTime
  | ChatAssistantInputValueString
  | ChatAssistantInputValueStringList
  | ChatAssistantInputValueBoolean
```

**Submit is all-or-nothing.** One `ChatMessageUserInput` per collection; the message log stays append-only and the "is this still
actionable?" check stays a render-time peek at the tail. Per-field submission would force partial state on the server and break that
contract. Within a single submit, every slot is independently optional — Submit is always enabled and partial (or fully empty) answers are
valid.

**The userInput row is folded into its collection's card, not rendered as its own message.** The card switches between three states based on
whether (and how) it has been answered:

- **Pending** — no userInput exists yet, AND the collection is the last message in the chat. Renders the interactive form with a single
  Submit button (always enabled).
- **Answered** — userInput has `answers.length > 0`. Renders a compact `prompt → formatted answer` summary with an "✓ Answered · {time}"
  footer.
- **Skipped** — userInput has `answers.length === 0` (the synthetic pivot row, below). Renders the questions muted with a "Skipped · {time}"
  footer.

The userInput row stays on the wire and in the database — `toModelMessages` still emits it as the `promptUserForInput` tool-result on replay
so the LLM sees the same turn shape. It just doesn't have its own visual element. This collapses one logical Q&A into one card and avoids
the post-submit reset and double-submit bugs the standalone-bubble rendering produced.

**Pivoting away produces an empty-answers userInput.** The user is never trapped by a question. The composer stays interactive while a
collection is on screen, and a free-text message implicitly closes the collection. When `chatMessageCreate` runs and the most recent
collection has no matching userInput, it synthesizes an empty-answers row — server-side, in the same transaction as the new user message,
timestamped one millisecond before it — so replay reads `collection → empty userInput → user message`. `toModelMessages` derives a
`status: 'answered' | 'skipped'` flag from `answers.length` and emits the row as a `promptUserForInput` tool-result with
`{ status, answers }`, preserving the AI SDK's "every tool-call has a tool-result" invariant; without that synthetic row, the next agent
step would throw `MissingToolResultsError`. The `promptUserForInput` tool description teaches the model what `skipped` means: drop the
question, pick up whatever the user just said, do not immediately re-ask.

This is deliberately a server-side _repair_, not a UI lock. Locking the composer until the form is submitted would force the user to either
answer or abandon the conversation, which is the wrong default for a chat surface.

### Tool calls expose arguments; results stay private

`ChatMessageToolCall` and `ChatMessageToolApprovalRequest` both carry an `args: JSON!` field. Arguments are user-facing context — they let
the UI render an "inspect arguments" affordance under the tool-call pill and let the human see exactly what the assistant is asking
permission to run before approving. The wire shape is the project's `JSON` scalar (from `graphql-scalars`' `JSONResolver`), passed verbatim
from the JSONB column the agent persists; per-tool typing lives at the tool boundary, not in the schema.

Tool **results** stay private. The schema therefore has no `ChatMessageToolResult` — the assistant interprets the result and emits a
follow-up `ChatMessageAssistantText` or input collection. Adding a result variant would leak structured payloads to the client and duplicate
work the LLM already does.

### Human-in-the-loop approval is a request/response pair, executed by the SDK

Some tools are safe to run autonomously (read-only lookups, idempotent calculations). Others have real-world side effects — DB writes,
outgoing mail, paid APIs, mutating user data. For the latter the assistant must pause and ask before executing.

The flow:

1. The assistant calls a tool whose name is marked `'user-approval'` on the agent's `toolApproval` map (AI SDK 7; the older per-tool
   `needsApproval` flag is deprecated — prefer the agent-level map).
2. The AI SDK suspends the agent loop and emits a `tool-approval-request` content part. `chatAssistantTurnRun.onStepEnd` persists this as a
   `ChatMessageToolApprovalRequest { approvalId, toolName, toolCallId, args }` row and skips writing a tool-call row for the suspended call.
3. The UI renders the request as an Approve / Decline affordance — same render path as any other assistant message, no special channel.
   Decline is a two-step affordance: it reveals an optional free-text textarea ("why decline?") and a Confirm button. Approve commits in one
   click.
4. The human responds via the `chatToolApprovalRespond` mutation, which durably writes a
   `ChatMessageToolApprovalResponse { approvalId, approved, reason }` row and kicks off the next assistant turn detached. The mutation does
   **not** execute the tool itself — execution is owned by the AI SDK. `reason` is optional and schema-symmetric (valid on approve too) so
   "approve with justification" is reachable later without a migration; today only Decline exposes the textarea.
5. On the next turn, `toModelMessages` replays the stored rows: the request becomes an assistant message carrying both a `tool-call` part
   and a `tool-approval-request` part; the response becomes a `tool` message with a `tool-approval-response` part carrying
   `{ approvalId, approved, reason? }`. The SDK's `collectToolApprovals` picks the response up, runs the approved tool's `execute` (or
   pushes a synthetic `execution-denied` tool-result for declines, with the human's `reason` attached so the LLM sees _why_ it was
   declined), and feeds the outcome back into the LLM. The natural tool-call/tool-result round-trip is then persisted by `onStepEnd` as a
   normal `ChatMessageToolCall` row whose `toolCallId` matches the original suspended call.

`approvalId` pairs request and response so multiple in-flight approvals (parallel tool calls, retries) don't get confused. Whether a given
tool requires approval is decided per turn on the agent via `toolApproval` — each chat surface decides its own policy when constructing its
agent (the user-conversation agent sets `writeToConsole: 'user-approval'` when `assistantOptions.requireToolCallApprovals` is on). Nested
sub-agent tools stay ungated once a parent `delegateTo*` brief is approved — see [agent-delegation.md](./agent-delegation.md).

`toModelMessages` is the single boundary that translates the persisted approval rows into the SDK's wire shape. The respond command itself
only writes the response row and kicks off the resumed turn — it never re-validates args, never imports tool definitions, and never calls
`execute`.

Approvals are deliberately separate from input collections: an approval is a control-flow gate over a tool call; an input collection is a
data-collection prompt. Folding them together would conflate "permission to act" with "values to act on".

### Generation metadata rides on every AI-produced variant

Each AI-produced variant (`ChatMessageAssistantText`, `ChatMessageToolCall`, `ChatMessageToolApprovalRequest`,
`ChatMessageAssistantInputCollection`) carries a nullable `generation: ChatMessageGeneration` field with the producing model id and per-step
token usage. The field is nullable because pre-feature rows have no snapshot. The columns are denormalized onto each variant table — see
[Chat Persistence — Generation metadata](./chat-persistence.md#generation-metadata-is-denormalized-onto-every-ai-produced-variant-row) for
the storage shape and the per-step duplication trade-off.

### Assistant presentation — ordered body blocks

`ChatMessageAssistantText` keeps a flattened `body: String!` for copy / titles / LLM replay, and exposes structured
`blocks: [ChatAssistantBodyBlock!]!` for rendering. The template foundation ships two block kinds:

- `ChatAssistantBodyBlockMarkdown` — prose
- `ChatAssistantBodyBlockCardList` — browseable cards (`ChatAssistantArtifactCard`)

The agent produces blocks via AI SDK `Output.object` (`assistantPresentationOutputSchema`). Live updates fan out
`ChatUpdateAssistantBlocksClear` / `ChatUpdateAssistantBlocksReplace` (id-only on the wire; the subscription resolver reloads blocks from
the in-process `chatAssistantLiveBlocks` store). Persisted rows store the payload as jsonb on `chatMessagesAssistantText.body` — see
[Chat Persistence](./chat-persistence.md).

Provider grounding citations land on `sources: [ChatMessageSource!]!` (UI-only; not replayed to the LLM).

### Nested tool calls

`ChatMessageToolCall` carries optional `parentChatMessageId` and `toolResult`. When a future `delegateTo*` tool pre-writes its parent row
via `chatDelegateParentPreWrite`, child tool calls persist with that parent id; the transcript filters them out of the top-level list and
renders them indented under the parent pill. See [agent-delegation.md](./agent-delegation.md). The template ships the spine
(`chatPersistStep` + pre-write helper) without a domain delegate catalog.

### Live updates flow through one chat-scoped subscription

```graphql
union ChatUpdate =
  | ChatUpdateMessageAppended
  | ChatUpdateAssistantTextChunk
  | ChatUpdateAssistantTextClear
  | ChatUpdateAssistantReasoningChunk
  | ChatUpdateAssistantBlocksClear
  | ChatUpdateAssistantBlocksReplace
  | ChatUpdateTurnEnded

type ChatUpdateMessageAppended {
  message: ChatMessage! # whichever variant just persisted
}

type ChatUpdateAssistantTextChunk {
  chatMessageId: ID! # current LLM step's pre-allocated id (final answer step → ChatMessageAssistantText)
  delta: String!
}

type ChatUpdateAssistantTextClear {
  chatMessageId: ID! # drops the live text buffer for this step id
}

type ChatUpdateAssistantReasoningChunk {
  chatMessageId: ID! # same per-step id; first tool / approval / collection / answer of that step reuses it
  delta: String! # Gemini thought-summary delta (`includeThoughts`); durable copy on that step's message.reasoning
}

type ChatUpdateTurnEnded {
  generationId: ID!
}

type Subscription {
  chatUpdates(generationId: ID!): ChatUpdate!
}
```

Every newly persisted message — user message, tool call, approval request/response, input collection, and the final assistant text —
publishes a `ChatUpdateMessageAppended` after the row commits. While the assistant is generating, each LLM step gets a **pre-allocated**
`chatMessageId` (`ChatStepArtifact`, rotated on AI SDK `start-step`). `text-delta` and `reasoning-delta` parts publish against that id; the
**first** persisted artifact of the step (tool call, approval request, input collection, or the final assistant text) reuses it so the live
preview swaps onto the settled row with no layout shift. Parallel tool calls in the same step mint fresh ids for siblings and leave
`reasoning` null on them — one Thought block, then N pills. Thought summaries are **per step**, not concatenated across the turn: a
tool-bearing step's thoughts land on that tool row; the final answer step's thoughts land on `ChatMessageAssistantText.reasoning`. Clients
clear live streaming/reasoning buffers when any matching `MessageAppended` arrives. `ChatUpdateTurnEnded` fires exactly once per turn
(success, agent throw, or downstream publish failure) so the client can tear down its per-turn state without waiting on the kicking-off
mutation.

Three rules fall out of this:

- **Subscription is the only live signal.** The page query loads the existing transcript on mount; everything after is the subscription.
  Sends never trigger a refetch.
- **Per-message transactions, publish-after-commit.** Each `(spine + variant)` write commits in its own short transaction; the
  `ChatUpdateMessageAppended` publish runs only after that commit returns. Subscribers therefore only ever see committed truth, and a
  mid-turn crash leaves the partial trail (user message, early tool calls) committed instead of silently rolling everything back. The
  `chats` row for a brand-new chat is committed up front in its own write before the user message inserts so the FK from
  `chatMessages.chatId → chats.chatId` resolves.
- **Auth = unguessable `generationId`.** The client allocates a UUIDv4 per turn; the unguessable id IS the capability. Real chat-level
  authorization will layer on once chats grow user ownership.

The single primitive that implements "commit + publish" is `chatMessageAppend` in `src/server/commands/chatMessageAppend.ts`. Every chat
command (`chatMessageCreate`, `chatInputCollectionRespond`, `chatToolApprovalRespond`) and the agent loop's `onStepEnd` use it; the publish
carries only the new row's `chatMessageId`, and the subscription resolver re-loads the joined row via `chatMessageFindOne` before delivery —
so subscribers receive a `ChatMessage` identical to what `chatFindOne` would have returned.

### Why the wire payload is the id, not the full message

`PubSubPostgres.publish` round-trips through `pg_notify`, which **caps NOTIFY payloads at 8000 bytes**. A long user message, a fat tool-call
args blob, or a multi-paragraph assistant text would blow the cap, the DB driver would reject the `pg_notify` call, and the chat command
would error after a successful write — committed truth that never reached its subscriber.

The fix is structural: the wire payload — `ChatUpdateWirePayload` in `src/server/graphql/chatUpdateWirePayload.ts` — only carries small
primitives (`{ kind: 'messageAppended', chatMessageId }`, streaming / reasoning chunk deltas, `assistantTextClear`, or the `turnEnded`
marker). The subscription resolver in `resolversCreate.ts` re-loads the row and maps it to the full GraphQL shape before handing it to
graphql-js. The shape that reaches the client is exactly what a re-fetch would have returned; the wire payload stays small and fixed-size
regardless of message body size.

`PubSubPostgres.publish` enforces this with a 7500-byte hard guard so any future publisher that tries to put a fat value on the wire fails
loudly at the call site, not deep inside the driver. **The rule: fan out via id, not value.**

The shared turn-runner `chatAssistantTurnRun` exposes `chatAssistantTurnRunDetached`, which all three write commands use to fire the
assistant turn on a void promise — the mutation returns as soon as the user-side row is durable, the agent runs detached, and the helper
bumps `chats.lastModifiedAt` after the turn finishes.

The client-side buffers in `useChatLiveUpdates` are multi-generation: each in-flight turn is its own generation with a `generationId`,
optional bound `chatId`, and per-step `streaming` / `reasoning` maps. A fresh send starts unbound (`chatId: null`) so deltas can land before
the mutation returns the allocated chat id; `bindTurn()` attaches it afterward. Reads are scoped via `appendedMessagesFor(chatId)`,
`streamingTextsFor(chatId)`, and `reasoningTextsFor(chatId)` so one chat's live rows never bleed into another. `forgetChat(chatId)` prunes
finished generations once authoritative rows are loaded.

### Date grouping is a UI concern, not a schema concern

Reads return a flat insertion-ordered `messages: [ChatMessage!]!`. Day separators are a near-universal chat-UI element, but the live
`chatUpdates` subscription delivers raw messages — so the client has to be the grouping authority anyway, and a server-side regrouping pass
would only run on the initial load before being thrown away. The transcript runs a sequential scan that groups by ISO calendar day
(`YYYY-MM-DD`) using the same boundary the wire `Date` scalar exposes.

### Latest-collection-only is a UI rule, not a schema rule

A `ChatMessageAssistantInputCollection` is interactive only when it is the **last message in the chat**. Any later message — the matching
`ChatMessageUserInput`, a free-text user message that triggered the synthetic empty-answers row, or an assistant follow-up of any kind —
locks the form. Older collections render as static history (the answered or skipped summary).

There is no per-message "answered" flag. The check is a one-liner on the merged transcript: peek at the tail and see whether it is the
collection in question. The rule "fires" automatically the moment any newer row lands — no flag to flip, no race window between submit and
lock.

`chatInputCollectionRespond` enforces a server-side counterpart: if a `ChatMessageUserInput` already exists for the requested
`collectionMessageId`, it returns `null` without writing a second row or kicking off an assistant turn. Multi-tab races and any non-UI path
are handled there rather than relying on the client-side rule alone.

## Removed alternatives

### Manual tool execution in the approval respond command

An earlier iteration kept a shared tool registry (`src/server/agents/agentUserConversationTools.ts`, since deleted) that both the agent and
`chatToolApprovalRespond` consumed. On approve, the respond command itself looked up the registry entry, re-validated the persisted
`toolArgs` against the registry's `inputSchema`, called `execute` directly (outside any DB transaction so a slow tool wouldn't hold a lock),
and synthesized a `chatMessagesToolCall` row keyed to the original `toolCallId` — bumping that row's `createdAt` one millisecond past the
response so replay read `request → response → call → result`. Declines stored a synthetic `{ error: 'approval_declined', message }` payload
as the tool result. `toModelMessages` then skipped both approval rows entirely; only the synthesized tool-call row reached the LLM.

That worked, but every piece of it was a parallel re-implementation of what the AI SDK already does: `collectToolApprovals` runs the
approved tool's `execute` itself when it sees a `tool-approval-response` part, and emits an `execution-denied` tool-result for declines.
Keeping the manual path also forced the registry indirection (the agent and the respond command both needed `inputSchema` and `execute` off
the same value), the unknown-tool-name guard for cross-deploy schema drift, the schema re-validation, the synthetic decline payload, and the
`+1ms createdAt` ordering hack. The SDK-driven path collapses all of that to "persist the response row, kick off the next turn"; tools live
in their own files and are wired directly into the agent's `tools` map.

## Consequences

- Every chat surface reuses one `ChatMessage` union; a schema-builder assistant chat and a team-support direct chat both query
  `Chat { messages { __typename ... } }`.
- Resolvers follow CQRS: reads in `src/server/queries/`, writes in `src/server/commands/`, wired in `resolversCreate.ts`. The shared
  turn-runner is the only place that drives the assistant.
- DB persistence, AI SDK replay, and history loading are documented in [Chat Persistence](./chat-persistence.md). This doc does not
  re-derive them.
- New union members are an SDL change + a `gqlTypeName` augmentation in `src/server/graphql/extensions.ts` + a mapper + a render-side switch
  case. The `<ChatMessage />` switch becomes a TypeScript error if a member is forgotten.
- The eight assistant-input kinds are owned by a single registry (`src/web/chat/chatAssistantInputKinds.ts`) — draft shape,
  draft-to-typed-value serializer, value-to-flat-input flattener, value-to-string formatter. Slot prompts are self-describing (no type
  headline). Adding a ninth kind touches that file, the GraphQL schema, and the persistence promoter.
- Concrete chat surfaces (with their agent choice, allowed tools, layout, empty state, etc.) get their own `docs/features/{name}.md` and
  reference this doc as their foundation.

## Key Files

- `src/server/graphql/chatUpdateWirePayload.ts` — lean NOTIFY payload (`messageAppended` id / chunk deltas / clear / `turnEnded`)
- `src/server/agents/chatStepArtifact.ts` — per-LLM-step id + text/reasoning buffers
- `src/server/graphql/extensions.ts` — `gqlTypeName` augmentations and `__resolveType` wiring
